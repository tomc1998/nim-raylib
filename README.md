These are generated raylib bindings from
[https://github.com/Guevara-chan/Raylib-Forever](https://github.com/Guevara-chan/Raylib-Forever),
with some extra vector operators for convenience. Extra functions are in
`raylib_util.nim` - these are included in `raylib.nim`.

This will require `raylib.so` to be on the library path when running - acquire
this separately.
